2022 is a bit tough for many of us. The pandemic disturbed many people's life.
The Chinese internet industry is not that prosperous in the year: many companies
layoffs and many people are unemployed, many game projects were aborted due to
suspended issued publishing licenses, many companies' share prices fell, and so on.
I was infected with COVID-19 at the end of 2022 and suffered from fever, body
aches, and fatigue for a week.

Anyway, It's worth celebrating at the beginning of 2023 as I'm still alive, I still
have a job, and I've done some meaningful work in the year. We still hope that the
world will be better and that all wishes come true.

### Goals

I finished some of the new year's resolutions for 2022.

- [x] Keep up learning English.
- [x] Finish reading *C++ Primer*
- [x] Read *Understand the Linux Kernel* *(4 chapters)*
- [x] Keep up daily LeetCode exercises
- [ ] Keep up writing blogs, at least one post a month *(only 9 posts)*
- [ ] Keep up exercises (running, push-up) *(did not run, just push-ups every day)*

### Learning

On weekends, I usually spend time reading tech books.

- Finished reading *C++ Primer*. Last year I read half of it.
- Read 4 chapters of *Understand the Linux Kernel*.

### LeetCode

This year I spent lots of time doing LeetCode, basically every day.

Now I've done 912 exercises, I think it might be a small achievement that's not
very easy to achieve. Doing LeetCode has somewhat improved my coding skill and
logical mind. it's a good habit that's worth keeping up.

### Language

English learning is not easy. I've spent plenty of time learning English, including
memorizing words and practicing listening and speaking. I insist on memorizing
words every day this year and until now, I've used Baicizhan to insist on memorizing
words for 1709 days.

I also spent lots of time on Open Language to practice listening and speaking. It
helped a lot at the beginning, but now I feel it doesn't help much. I think I've hit
the English learning plateau.

In addition to English learning, I've been learning Japanese on Duolingo. I didn't
spend much time on that, basically two units a day. It's just for fun.

### Creating

- (only) Wrote 9 post on my blog.

This year I didn't create much work in my spare time. I intended to use C++ to write
a VPN software, but I only completed the most basic feature and have not released an
initial version. I just had some sporadic commit records on Github.

### Something Happy

The happiest thing is that I've had a good time with the people I love. Thanks for her
company to make me no longer feel lonely.

### Finally

Not long ago I revisited *My Life as McDull (麦兜故事)*, a famous Hongkong film I
watched when I was a kid. But I didn't understand its profound central idea at that
age. I love what it said at the ending:

> Roasted chicken is easy to cook. The material is a chicken; the method is to take
> a chicken and roast it, and then it's done. If you want it to be delicious, the secret
> is to cook it better.

Well, life might be a simple process from birth to death. It's simple, but it also can be
complicated if you want. If you want it to be beautiful, the secret is to be positive and
try to make it better.

Although we might be going to face challenges in 2023, we still believe that good things
are about to happen. Happy New Year to us.
