In 2023 I spent most of my time on work, learning <span style="background-color: var(--post-text-color)">and dating</span>. Compared with the last year, devoted less time on this blog and community. It might be a pretext but to be honest, writing a blog post always consumes a lot of my energy, especially when there was a lot of overtime this year. Anyway, I should write more posts in the new year, and I'll try to write some non-technical posts (well, partially because they're easy to write (and read)).

Let's talk a little about professional skills over here. In the past, I focused most of my efforts on coding skill, rather than engineering skills, or let's say, the business skills. This is because I love the hacker spirit, and am fascinated by intricate program structures and algorithms. But your boss just need one who solve problems, them don't care about computer science. To solve a problem, you have to consider many things other than the computer - namely, the people around you. And that's exactly what software engineering does - to use some engineering methods to prevent or eliminate mistakes made by humans. So when I focus on hacking, I must keep an open mind on other skills, especially those methodologies for problem-solving.

## Goals

- [x] Keep up learning English
- [ ] Read *Understanding the Linux Kernel* (I'm not sure if I can finish it)
- [x] Keep up daily LeetCode exercises
- [ ] Keep up writing blogs, basically one post a month
- [x] Read some non-technical books
- [x] Keep up exercises

## Learning

I finished learning *Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP)*, an amazing book. Its content comprised of functional programming, layering of program and data structure, OOP, infinite streams, the metacircular evaluator, lazy evaluation, compilation principle, etc. I have to say, *SICP* opened the gate of computer science for me. Before then, I don't really comprehend the essential of computer science.

## LeetCode

I kept on doing LeetCode like the past few years. The grid looks not bad.

Now I've solved 1182 problems. Last year it's 912, so I solved 270 problems in 2023.

## Language

I kept learning English in 2023, as I did in the past few years. After continuously learning vocabulary on the APP *baicizhan* for 2024 days, I found it might not be a very effective way to memorize new words for me at the moment. Therefore, In November, I started learning *Merriam-Webster's Vocabulary Builder*. This book organizes words by their roots, besides telling you how to use a word, its history, and related knowledge.

I also read another amazing vocabulary builder, *Word Power Made Easy*. To me, this book like an introduction to the etymology and at the same time teaches you how to memorize over 3,000 words and continue building your vocabulary.

In addition, I kept leaning Japanese on Duolingo as I did in 2022.

## Creating

I only wrote 6 posts on the blog.

I created a repo [luyuhuang/nvim](https://github.com/luyuhuang/nvim), but it's just for personal configuration, should not be considered as a contribution. I submitted some pull requests and issues to the community and some of have been accepted.

## Something Happy

Hiking and seeing the skyline of the city at the summit is quite happy, especially with the one you love.

## Finally

At the end of a year, I always feel time flies by quickly. But after I wrote the annual review, I found that the time of a year is quite long, because you can literally do many things in a year and grow quite a bit in certain aspects (say, I found my English writing skill is much better than the last year). So in the new year, keep learning and growing, and I believe we'll get a better result. Happy New Year to everybody.
