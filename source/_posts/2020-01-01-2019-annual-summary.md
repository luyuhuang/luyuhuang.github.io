On September 15, 2017, the first day I joined the company, I told myself that I joined a good company which has a good treatment but I was not feeling happy at all. I had plenty of worry and confusion at that moment because I didn't know my direction.

All I can do is working hard and learning as much as possible.

At the beginning of 2019, I told myself that 2019 is crucial for me. I must do something that will allow me to seize the opportunity that gives me a clear direction.

Time flies and many events happened in 2019. Maybe it didn't meet my expectations, but fortunately I didn't feel regret.

Today is January 1, 2020, it's time to make a summary.

## Annual Targets

### Unfinished Targets

- Read Lua source code

    I didn't finish reading the code, I only read part of it. But it's a start, I have started to understand some of these principles.

- Finish [OpenGL tutorial](http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/)

    I didn't have time to learn it since I didn't finish reading Lua source code.

- Read 10 books

    Only 6.

### Finished Targets

- Memorize words every day

    I did it.

- Finish reading *CLRS*, and then read *TCP/IP Illustrated*

    I did it. But the translation of *TCP/IP Illustrated* is too bad, So I read *Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications* instead of it.

## English

I kept remembering words every day and completed daily plan every day except June 22 due to too busy that day to finish the plan before 00:00.

I have been remembering words for 605 days. I'm not good at language learning and I used to hate English. Nevertheless, for programmers, English is essential and it's a basic skill. I have overcome many difficulties and now I can read English articles more easily. In the future I hope I can hold on and improve writing and speaking skills.

## Technology

- I finished reading *CLRS* except the last two chapter due to I didn't have enough mathematical knowledge to understand it.
- I read about 1/3 of *Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications*.
- I have been doing algorithmic exercises on [LeetCode](https://leetcode-cn.com/) since June. It's difficult for me, but this is the beginning.

- I built [my tech blog](https://luyuhuang.github.io) and wrote 17 posts.
- I have been contributing on GitHub since September, it taught me a lot.

    I hope it'll be full of green spots in 2020.

- I read part of Lua source code following [this guide](https://github.com/lichuang/Lua-Source-Internal). I have understood some of these principles.

## Reading

I read 6 books in 2019.

- *The Tale of Genji*
- *A Tale of Two Cities*
- *Notre-Dame de Paris*
- *No Longer Human*
- *The Romance of the Three Kingdoms*
- *Journey Under the Midnight Sun*

The two books that impressed me most were *Notre-Dame de Paris* and *Journey Under the Midnight Sun*.

## Something Happy

On November 9 I attended the *LisAni! LIVE Beijing* concert and met Nitta Emi. This is my happiest day in years.

## Finally

The most comforting is that I still love programming despite I graduated from college over 2 years. I feel so happy: what I work every day is what I love. I hope to keep it like this in the future.

I hope to make some changes in the future, I hope I won't feel confused in the future.

Hello 2020. It must be a new beginning.
